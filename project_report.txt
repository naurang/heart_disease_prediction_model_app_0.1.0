**Title**: Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning

**Author**: Suraj Singh

**Date**: 2023

---

**Abstract**

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes. Heart disease is a significant health concern globally, and early detection plays a crucial role in effective treatment and prevention. Leveraging Python-based machine learning libraries and techniques, this project explores the feasibility of predicting heart disease risk using clinical parameters.

**1. Introduction**

Cardiovascular diseases, including heart disease, are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early detection and intervention are essential for improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease. This project aims to address this challenge by developing a predictive model for identifying individuals at risk of heart disease based on their medical attributes.

---

**2. Problem Definition**

The primary objective of this project is to predict whether a person has heart disease or not based on clinical parameters. This involves building a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying individuals into two categories: those with heart disease and those without.

---

**3. Data**

The dataset used for this project was sourced from the Cleveland dataset available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle. It contains various medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

**4. Methodology**

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset underwent preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

- **Model Selection**: Three machine learning models were evaluated: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**: The models were trained and evaluated using techniques such as cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Deployment**: The selected model was deployed using a Flask web application to enable easy prediction of heart disease risk.

**5. Results**

The Logistic Regression model emerged as the most effective, achieving an accuracy score of approximately 88.52%. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were also assessed, demonstrating the model's robustness.

**6. Conclusion**

In conclusion, this project successfully developed a machine learning model capable of predicting heart disease risk based on clinical parameters. The Logistic Regression model exhibited high accuracy and reliability, making it suitable for practical deployment in healthcare settings. Early detection of heart disease can significantly impact patient outcomes, and this predictive model represents a valuable tool for healthcare professionals.

**7. Future Work**

Future enhancements to this project could include:
- Integration of additional data sources to improve model performance.
- Development of a user-friendly interface for easier interaction with the predictive model.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of the model to ensure its relevance and accuracy over time.
